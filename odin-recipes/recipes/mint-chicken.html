    <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.</p>

     <h4>Ingredients</h4>
     <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>Half cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Half cup margarine</li>
        <li>A quarter cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>A quarter cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
     </ul>

     <h4>Steps</h4>

     <ol>
         <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
         <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
